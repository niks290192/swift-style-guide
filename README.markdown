# Swift Style Guide.
### Updated for Swift 4.2

This style guide is different from others you may see, because the focus is centered on readability for print and the web. We created this style guide to keep the code in our books, tutorials, and starter kits nice and consistent - even through we have many different authors working on the books.

Our overarching goals are clarity, consistency and bervity, in that order
